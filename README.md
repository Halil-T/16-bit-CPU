# **Final Project Report**

Halil Turan, Darren Chau, ECE-251

For this project, we decided to implement a 16-bit single cycle CPU.

For the Instruction Set Architecture, we implemented 16 operations, as can be seen in the [operations file](https://github.com/Halil-T/16-bit-SingleCycle-CPU/blob/2bded82533e591941ee77c3c91d5781174cde95a/operations)
